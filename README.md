## Project Description  
Team Delta is developing an AI-powered social media platform designed to modernize user experience and help the platform compete with emerging, AI-driven competitors. The main goal is to implement artificial intelligence features that improve accessibility, engagement, and content fairness.

### ðŸŒŸ Core AI Features  
- **Video Closed Captioning:** Automatically generates captions for uploaded videos to improve accessibility for all users.  
- **Home Feed Summary:** Scans the user's home feed and produces concise summaries of media content for quick updates.  
- **Harmful Content Detection:** Allows users or the system to flag potentially harmful or unsafe content for moderation.  
- **Bias Review in AI Systems:** Audits AI recommendation systems to ensure fairness and inclusivity in suggested content.  
- **Real-Time Subtitles and Translations:** Provides AI-generated translations and subtitles for posts in other languages to foster global interaction.  
- **Emotion-Based Video Summaries:** Creates short summaries that reflect the emotional tone of videos, enhancing engagement and storytelling.  
- **Auto-Trimming and Highlight Generation:** Automatically trims videos and generates highlight reels to simplify content creation.

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience  
Our project is designed for **general social media users**, specifically **teens and young adults aged 13â€“25**, who seek a smarter, more inclusive, and globally connected platform.

## Installation Instructions  
> Note: The platform is still under development. The following steps represent the planned setup process.

### For Local Development  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Team-Delta/AI-Social-Media.git
   cd AI-Social-Media
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
  ```
  bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # for macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows
  ```

3. Install dependencies (to be updated as development continues):
```
  bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # for macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate     # for Windows
```

4.Run the development server:
```bash
  python app.py
```

## Planned Web Deployment

A web-based version of the app will be developed for online access once the core features are stable. The deployment will likely use a cloud-based hosting platform with AI integration through Gemini (Google) or similar LMM tools.

## Diagram / Visual Explanation

A simple GUI and feature flow diagram are in progress for presentation next week.
(Placeholder for visuals: screenshots, demo video, or system architecture diagram to be added later.)

## Known Issues

* LMM (Large Multimodal Model) not yet selected for AI feature integration.

* Limited initial coding progress â€” most features are currently in the design phase.

* Pending selection of front-end framework for GUI development.

* Need for real-time processing optimization for captioning and translation tools.

## To-Do Items

 - [] Select and integrate an LMM (likely Gemini or OpenAI-based).

 - [] Build the initial GUI for demo presentation.

 - [] Implement video captioning and feed summarization modules.

 - [] Add AI moderation and bias review systems.

 - [] Develop user testing framework for accessibility and fairness.

 - [] Prepare final presentation visuals and documentation.
